# Go service layer

A common set of libraries for use in Go projects.

The main job of this project is to provide self-configuring libraries for 3rd 
party tools such as Cassandra, NSQ etc.

See https://hailo.jira.com/wiki/display/Agile/2014/02/25/Shared+Code for details of how this library is managed.
